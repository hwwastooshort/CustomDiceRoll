# CustomDiceRoll
- This is a personal project for learing iOS Development, especially SwiftUI
- Currently, this App doesn't do very much. It should be able to interpret the commom dice roll syntax used in TTRPGs such as DnD and Pathdfinder
```
Example:
2d6 + 8 -> 2 rolls of a dice with 6 sides plus 8  (3 + 4 + 8 -> 15)
```

# CustomDiceRoll

CustomDiceRoll is a personal project designed to learn iOS development, particularly SwiftUI. The app interprets and evaluates common dice roll syntax used in Tabletop RPGs (TTRPGs) like Dungeons & Dragons (DnD) and Pathfinder.

## Example

```plaintext
2d6 + 8 -> Two rolls of a 6-sided dice plus 8
(3 + 4 + 8 -> 15)
```

## Features

- Supports the usual DnD Syntax like 3d6, 2d8 + 2, (2d8 - 3) * 2
- Simple Calculations inside the Rolls

# Why this Project?
I want to deepen my understanding of iOS development, especially SwiftUI.
I also wanted to write my own parser (with help, of course) to revise some concepts I heard in my theoretical computer science class.
There isn’t a cool app that does this offline and as simply as I want it, so I figured I’d do it myself.




I used Dmitry Soshnikov’s YouTube series for help, and string formatting & bug fixing was partially done via ChatGPT.
The project isn’t finished; I still have to complete the UI.
